  **What is async? What is defer?** <br />
  More here: https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-async-defer/ <br />

## SEO
*Meta descriptions* (usually used for Google search text snippets) are available as a custom field in each post and page. This field is also the text that will appear when sharing posts or pages on social media. If the field is left blank, search and social media will determine the text. 

*Sharing image* is the Featured Image field for each post and page. If no image is present, the default image in the Wordpress admin section under *Social Media + Sharing* will be used.



## Best Practices

Use `font-display: swap` in `@font-face` declarations
