Looking for cwebp binaries.
Discovering if a plain cwebp call works (to skip this step, disable the "try-cwebp" option)
- Executing: cwebp -version 2>&1. Result: version: *0.5.1*
We could get the version, so yes, a plain cwebp call works
Discovering binaries using "which -a cwebp" command. (to skip this step, disable the "try-discovering-cwebp" option)
Found 0 binaries
Discovering binaries by peeking in common system paths (to skip this step, disable the "try-common-system-paths" option)
Found 1 binaries:

Discovering binaries which are distributed with the webp-convert library (to skip this step, disable the "try-supplied-binary-for-os" option)
Checking if we have a supplied precompiled binary for your OS (Darwin)... We do.
