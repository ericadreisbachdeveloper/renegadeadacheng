## SEO
*Meta descriptions* (usually used for Google search text snippets) are available as a custom field in each post and page. This field is also the text that will usually appear when links to the site are shared on social media.

*Sharing image* defaults to the Featured Image field for each post and page. If no image is present, the default image under *Social Media + Sharing* in the Wordpress admin section will be used.

*Schema* ... ?


## Styles
This site was built with SASS to generate two main style files: `css/style.css` and `css/later.css`.

`style.css` loads mobile-first header, nav, and necessary page structure styles.

`later.css` loads footer and later-load styles.
